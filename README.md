# JS Higher Order Functions
As part of my Codenation 12 week bootcamp, I was tasked with three activities involving Higher Order Functions
## Activities

### Activity 1:
Write a simple function that logs â€˜Hello Codenation" to the console.
Then write a higher-order function which will run the simple function five times, even though you only call it once.
Hint: Pass the simple function as a parameter, which will involve a For loop.

### Activity 2: 
The array method .map is an example of a higher-order function.
Declare a variable with five numbers, then use .map to iterate through the array and multiply each array item by 3.

### Activity 3: 
Test this function (See app.js) to ensure it works by passing a number to the doMaths function.
Then passing a number and one of the four maths functions to the returned function.
